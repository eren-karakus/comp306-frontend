<h1>COMP 306 Project - Athlete Tracking App </h1>

Requirements:
Flask
Bcrypt
mysql-connector-python
Faker (for data generation)

<p>Run your local MySQL server and create the "gym" database in it by executing the queries in "gym.sql".</p>
<p>Create a "password.txt" file inside the folder and write your password to the MySql server in it.</p>
<p>Run the flask server with "python run.py" command.</p>

Note: As it stands, the dummy data uses the same password (123456) for every user. This was done in order to make testing between different types of users easier. The system is capable of handling standard hash values that would be used in a real scenario.
